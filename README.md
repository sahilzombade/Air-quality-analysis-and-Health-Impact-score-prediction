# Air Quality Analysis and Health Impact Score Prediction

This repository contains the code and data for my Air Quality Analysis and Health Impact Score Prediction project.

## Project Description
This project aims to analyze air quality data and predict health impact scores based on various air pollutants and weather conditions. The goal is to understand how different environmental factors affect public health and to develop a predictive model for health impact scores.

## Files
- `notebook.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data analysis, visualization, and model building.
- `data.csv`: The dataset used for the project, containing air quality metrics, weather data, and health impact scores.

## Usage
To run the notebook:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required libraries listed in the notebook.
3. Open the `notebook.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

## Results
The project provides insights into the relationship between air quality and health impact. The predictive model developed in this project can be used to estimate health impact scores based on current air quality data.
